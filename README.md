# Security-Alarm-with-Arduino
The security alarm in this project was built using arduino and an ultra sonic sensor. When an obstrcution is found within the coverage area of the sensor the buzzer makes a sound so that the users will be alarmed about the particular situation. The alarm in this project consists of an LED bulb as well in order to light when an obstruction is met. This is a simple project built as a sollution for the domestic security concerns. Hope you enjoy the projectðŸ™‚!!!
